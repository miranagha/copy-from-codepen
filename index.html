		<article id="About">
			<h1>What is Deep Brain Stimulation?</h1>
			<p><strong>DBS</strong> is a surgical procedure in which thin, insulated electrodes are inserted into the brain. These electrodes are then connected by a wire under the skin to a battery usually implanted in the chest or in the abdomen. The battery operates similarly to a pacemaker delivering targeted electrical pulses that block the signals that cause the symptoms of dystonia. The battery is implanted below the skin on the chest wall (or sometimes the lower abdominal wall) so is barely visible but an outline of its shape and of the wires connecting it to the brain may be visible.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The procedure is also used to treat essential tremor, a common neurological movement disorder.</li>
				<li>DBS does not damage healthy brain tissue by destroying nerve cells. Instead the procedure blocks electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.</li>
				<li>At present, the procedure is used only for patients whose symptoms cannot be adequately controlled with medications.DBS uses a surgically implanted, battery-operated medical device called a neurostimulator—similar to a heart pacemaker and approximately the size of a stopwatch—to deliver electrical stimulation to targeted areas in the brain that control movement, blocking the abnormal nerve signals that cause tremor and PD symptoms. Before the procedure, a neurosurgeon uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify and locate the exact target within the brain where electrical nerve signals generate the PD symptoms <a href="http://bit.ly/1n6Ysnx" target="_blank"><span style="color:#595959;">read more</span></a>

			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<p>The carefully controlled, minute electrical currents delivered through the electrodes on both sides of the brain can have a beneficial effect on the involuntary muscle contractions caused by dystonia. As a result, the symptoms of dystonia such as abnormal movements and postures and/or dystonic tremor can be eased. In addition, DBS can reduce the pain caused by dystonia. The electrodes are usually implanted into an area known as the Globus Pallidus Interna (GPi). Stimulation of this area is known as pallidal stimulation. Occasionally, another part of the brain, the thalamus, is targeted instead.</p>

		<article id="risks">
			<h1>What are the risks?</h1>
			<p>All surgical procedures carry a degree of risk both from the surgery and the introduction of anaesthesia. However, when complications do occur they are usually mild and short-lived. The risks of the procedure should be discussed with the treatment centre prior to going ahead. One leading UK implant centre reports the main risks of the procedure at their centre as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>stroke / intracranial bleeding / hemiplegia (below 1% of cases</li>
				<li>seizure (2%)</li>
				<li>infection from the implanted device (2-4%)</li>
				<li>Other risks include malfunction of the device (1.8%)</li>
				<li>fracture of the lead (0.7%).</li>
				<li>Other problems that can arise over time include speech problems (dysarthria) but these can usually be reversed by adjusting the settings on the device.</li>
